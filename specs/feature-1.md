## Development Tasks

### Frontend Tasks

#### 1. Create Story Editor Component
```typescript
// Unit Tests:
- Should render empty editor state
- Should accept initial content
- Should handle formatting commands
- Should maintain undo/redo history

// Integration Tests:
- Should sync content with backend
- Should handle concurrent edits
```

#### 2. Element Selector Component
```typescript
// Unit Tests:
- Should render element categories
- Should filter elements by type
- Should maintain selected elements list

// Integration Tests:
- Should fetch elements from API
- Should update story context on selection
```

#### 3. AI Generation Interface
```typescript
// Unit Tests:
- Should validate story parameters
- Should display generation progress
- Should handle error states

// Integration Tests:
- Should communicate with AI service
- Should update editor with generated content
```

#### 4. Story Preview Component
```typescript
// Unit Tests:
- Should render formatted content
- Should display element references
- Should match publication layout

// Integration Tests:
- Should load story data
- Should reflect real-time edits
```

### Backend Tasks

#### 1. Story Service Implementation
```python
# Unit Tests:
- Should create story records
- Should validate story parameters
- Should handle element associations

# Integration Tests:
- Should coordinate with AI service
- Should manage element service interactions
```

#### 2. AI Integration Service
```python
# Unit Tests:
- Should generate valid prompts
- Should process AI responses
- Should handle rate limiting

# Integration Tests:
- Should communicate with LLM API
- Should maintain context consistency
```

#### 3. Element Context Manager
```python
# Unit Tests:
- Should aggregate element data
- Should validate element relationships
- Should track element usage

# Integration Tests:
- Should update element metadata
- Should maintain referential integrity
```

#### 4. Story Storage Service
```python
# Unit Tests:
- Should persist story content
- Should handle version control
- Should manage metadata

# Integration Tests:
- Should coordinate with databases
- Should handle concurrent saves
```

### Database Tasks

#### 1. Story Schema Implementation
```sql
# Unit Tests:
- Should enforce data constraints
- Should maintain relationships
- Should handle text content

# Integration Tests:
- Should scale with content size
- Should support efficient queries
```

#### 2. Element Reference System
```sql
# Unit Tests:
- Should track element usage
- Should maintain referential integrity
- Should support version control

# Integration Tests:
- Should handle concurrent updates
- Should support complex queries
```

### DevOps Tasks

#### 1. AI Service Deployment
```yaml
# Unit Tests:
- Should validate configuration
- Should check resource allocation
- Should verify security settings

# Integration Tests:
- Should monitor performance
- Should handle scaling events
```

#### 2. Story Service Deployment
```yaml
# Unit Tests:
- Should verify service dependencies
- Should validate endpoints
- Should check logging

# Integration Tests:
- Should test load balancing
- Should verify backup systems
```

## Task Dependencies

- Frontend tasks can be worked on in parallel with backend service implementation
- Story Service must be completed before AI Integration Service
- Database schema must be implemented before Story Storage Service
- DevOps tasks should be started early but can be completed last

## Timeline Estimation

1. **Week 1-2**: Database Schema and Basic Story Service
2. **Week 2-3**: Frontend Components and AI Integration
3. **Week 3-4**: Integration and Testing
4. **Week 4**: DevOps and Deployment

## Success Metrics

- Story creation success rate > 95%
- AI generation response time < 5s
- Editor autosave success rate > 99%
- System uptime > 99.9%
- User satisfaction score > 4.5/5

## Risk Mitigation

1. **AI Service Availability**
   - Implement fallback content generation
   - Cache common prompts
   - Set up redundant API endpoints

2. **Data Consistency**
   - Implement robust transaction management
   - Set up automatic backups
   - Version all content changes

3. **Performance**
   - Implement content pagination
   - Cache frequently accessed elements
   - Set up monitoring and alerts

4. **Security**
   - Regular security audits
   - Input sanitization
   - Rate limiting on all endpoints
